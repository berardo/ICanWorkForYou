A passionate web enthusiast and a senior software developer.

Since 2000, I have dealt with HTML, CSS, Javascript and server side technologies around PHP and Java. Throughout these years, I have assumed different roles like web development, team leadership, external consulting/mentoring, software architecture and teaching. Over the last ten years, I have managed a company focused on web development and mainly on training.
It gave me opportunities on heading my own project teams as well as working within client's workforce, under their project management policies, mostly agile methodologies like Scrum.
Now living in Sydney, I am already working as a PHP developer in a law company.

## I Can Work For You

It is a simple project to show my background in Java and PHP.

It is compounded by a Java desktop application that simulates a web server.
Under [src](https://github.com/berardo/ICanWorkForYou/tree/master/src/) directory you find all Java sources.
A swing JFrame with buttons to start and stop a Socket. When you click at the start button, it will create
a ServerSocket at port 8001 (it must not be in use).

After that, open the address http://localhost:8001 and enjoy the PHP part of the project.

The PHP part loads a framework that I developed years ago. You can find out more about this framework 
at [FacilMVC](https://github.com/phppe/FacilMVC).
